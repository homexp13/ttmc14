  description: "TerraGov Marine Corps' experimental High Point-Singularity 'Harvester' knife. An advanced version of the HP-S Harvester blade, shrunken down to the size of the standard issue boot knife. It trades the harvester blades size and power for a smaller form, with the side effect of a miniscule chemical storage, yet it still keeps its ability to apply debilitating effects to its targets. Activate after loading to prime a single use of an effect. It also harvests substances from alien lifeforms it strikes when connected to the Vali system."
