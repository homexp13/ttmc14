  name: Select Reagent
  description: Selects which reagent to use for reagent slash and noxious gas. Hemodile slows targets down, multiplied by each other xeno-based toxin. Transvitox converts burns to toxin, and causes additional toxin damage when they take brute damage, both effects multiplied by other xeno-based toxins. Ozelomelyn purges all medicines from their system rapidly and causes minor toxin damage. Acid is transparent but causes major burn damage.
